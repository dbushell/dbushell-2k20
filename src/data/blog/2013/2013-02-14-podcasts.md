I can't get enough podcasts right now.

I still love the written word but after a full day of design and code my eyes need a rest (and probably a new test, now that I think about it).

Fearing I'd been overlooking a few [I asked Twitter](https://twitter.com/dbushell/status/301644965489020929) — thanks for the replies! Below is a compilation of my favourite shows and a few suggestions.

[Boagworld](http://boagworld.com/show/) was the first web industry podcast I ever listened to. I'm a huge fan of Paul's video and audio blogging, something I wish others would emulate. Why do I only type? Might change that habit this year…

Having recently "gone freelance" * I'm finding [Unfinished Business](http://unfinished.bz/) with [Anna Debenham](https://twitter.com/anna_debenham) and [Andy Clarke](https://twitter.com/malarkey) to be absolutely invaluable. It really couldn't have arrived at a more useful time. It's five episodes in and already ticked off most of the uncertainties I had starting a new web design business.

[ShopTalk Show](http://shoptalkshow.com/) is always a good laugh with superb guests, as is [Happy Monday](http://happymondaypodcast.com/).

[Upfront Podcast](http://upfrontpodcast.com/) and [Back to Front Show](http://backtofrontshow.com/) are two dev-orientated podcasts I'm keeping an ear on. Both have been entertaining so far.

[The East Wing](http://theeastwing.net/) with [Tim Smith](https://twitter.com/ttimsmith) slipped under my radar but it's bookmarked now.

[5by5](http://5by5.tv/) and [Twit](http://twit.tv/) both have a whole host of shows I regularly dive into.

Other Podcasts I need to catch up on are [The Industry](http://theindustry.cc/category/podcast/), [BizCraft](http://unmatchedstyle.com/bizcraft), [The Non-Breaking Space Show](http://nonbreakingspace.tv/) and [Breaking Development](http://fsm.bdconf.com/podcast). I'm also looking forward to what [Rachel Shillcock](https://twitter.com/missrachilli) has in store for [Beyond Ink](http://beyondink.co.uk/).

Anything I'm missing your favourite? [I'm all ears](http://twitter.com/dbushell).
