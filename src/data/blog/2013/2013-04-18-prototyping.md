A [couple of weeks ago](/2013/04/07/macaque-a-new-project/) I embarked upon a new side quest: make a list app and use as much JavaScript in the stack as possible. Fighting adversity, I've made progress:

💤 [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/) is a great UI toolkit for prototypes. Don't let it seduce you, my underlying code ain't pretty!

## Learning Curve

After the excitement of last weekend's [test driven development](/2013/04/14/test-driven-development/) phase I hit hard times and considered throwing in the towel once or twice. I have very little experience with MVC frameworks. In fact, with the exception of a terrible two days flirting with Backbone, I've have none.

What exists in the [Ember Guides](http://emberjs.com/guides/) is very good but far from complete as you'd expect from such a new technology. [Ember Data](https://github.com/emberjs/data) is still under development so little documentation exists. For someone who has 'designer' written on his business cards; this is _very_ slow learning. StackOverflow has rescued me many times. [Ember Watch](http://emberwatch.com/) is also an excellent resource. Progress may be glacial, but I'm moving forward. **Macaque** is far from complete but you see the [code on GitHub](https://github.com/dbushell/Macaque).

## Experimental

Although I'm kind of ad-libbing this entire thing, I'm keen to tie in several project methodologies. I started with a half-hearted attempt at agile user stories (_user can use to-do app_). Unsurprisingly, it's transpired that development is now meandering through whatever aspects of Ember I happen to figure out. This evolutionary approach isn't quite what I had in mind. Once I feel more comfortable with Ember I'll take a step back and refocus the project scope.

This process is very good for [agile design](/2012/09/17/agile-website-design-and-development/). Right now I'm letting development lead the experience and making design decisions as and when required. That's not much right now, which is a good thing. I'm not over committing to style or interaction that could prove impossible later (or ill-advised). It may be a simple concept but designing whilst actually _using_ the app is a lot better than designing from imagination alone.
