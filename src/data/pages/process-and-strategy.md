The web industry has come a long way and has a bight future. It's crazy to think that monolithic projects were once the norm. Successful websites are ones that get published. They're lightweight, nimble, and reactive.

From scoping requirements to planning content — through design and development — collaboration between myself and my clients is paramount. It's simply about getting things done. Seeing the result, and improving upon them. Every project is different. [Get in touch](/contact/) and we can discuss yours.
