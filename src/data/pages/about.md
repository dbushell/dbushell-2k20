title: 'About David Bushell'
---
Based in the UK, somewhere near Manchester, I design, build, and consult upon all things web for small businesses, start-ups, individuals, and fellow web agencies â€” all over the world. It's quite a fun job if I'm honest.

While I specialise in front-end development, my experience and knowledge covers the whole process. So if anyone asks, tell them [I make websites](/services/).

### My Philosophy

I create things online with longevity in mind. Designing for the future is profitable and leaves a lasting impression. Coding for performance leads to meaningful experiences and delighted users.

I pride myself in a collaborative and considered process. A process that is agile and evolving. Iterative and effective. I like to give ideas an opportunity to develop. There is no *'one size fits all'* solution but the answer is waiting to be discovered.

### My Experience

I have over a decade of professional experience. It started, well, over a decade ago. The web and my work has changed a lot in that time.

Prior to my life as a freelancer, and following graduation, I worked in London's East End for five years at two digital agencies. I moved into a senior client-facing role taking on responsibility for most design and front-end development.

During this time I worked with just about every type of client imaginable. From public sector departments, to small local businesses, and those in-between like charities and enthusiastic entrepreneurs. I found that a personable and attentive approach instilled confidence. Rather than trying to 'sell' a website I'd involve clients in the process to design it alongside us.


In early 2013 I moved back up North to venture out as a freelancer. I kicked things off by speaking at the [Responsive Day Out](/2012/12/07/responsive-day-out/) conference in Brighton, UK. Since then I've continue to provide my skills to many web agencies and clients.

On the web, I consider myself self-taught. Programming has fascinated me since the days of dial-up modems and floppy disks. My formal education is firmly rooted in the finer arts. I graduated with 1st class honours in Graphic Design at Cumbria University, UK.

### My Work Online

I write about what I do on [my blog](/blog/)Â and shares ideas,Â inspiration, and nonsense [@dbushell](http://twitter.com/dbushell) on Twitter. I've written [articles](http://smashingmagazine.com/author/david-bushell/) for industry leader *Smashing Magazine*. I host several popular open-source [projects on GitHub](https://github.com/dbushell). You can find me on [CodePen](http://codepen.io/dbushell/) where I play around with code.
