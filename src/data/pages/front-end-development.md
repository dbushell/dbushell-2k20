Static design mock-ups may look pretty, but you can't experience true performance in Photoshop. I prefer to work in iterations of design, prototype, test and review — allowing final decisions to be made in the browser.

Through coding I can deliver:

* An entire website ...
* ... or just a little bit of maintenance?
* Templates for many frameworks
* Pattern and component libraries
* Build and deployment workflows
* Performance and accessibility reviews
* Progressive web apps

Web standards are ever-evolving. I see each project as an opportunity to refresh my methods and hone my practice. I understand the quirks of old browsers and the benefits of new technology. I use progressive enhancement to deliver accessible websites based on an intrinsic knowledge of the front-end.

I'm not fussy. I can work with high-fidelity design software or back-of-the-napkin sketches. My background in design gives me an intuitive understanding to interpret, iterate upon, and best utilise visual concepts.
